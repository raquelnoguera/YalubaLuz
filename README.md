# Yaluba Luz

WEB UI created with [VueJS 3](https://vuejs.org/) and [Quasar](https://quasar.dev/) 
to provide access to electricity prices in Spain using the API of Red Eléctrica
de España (REE).

The API of REE is available [here](https://www.ree.es/es/apidatos). Access is totally
free and it supports [CORS headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS).

As of May 2022, the work is ongoing. There will be improvements soon. Keep tunned!!!

The current site is running at [Yaluba Luz](http://luz.yaluba.com).

The chart works well on large displays, but looks horrible on a mobile device. 
I know that I need to fix that :-)
